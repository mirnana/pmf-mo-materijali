# How do we automatize this?
# let's program a mining module that receives the following:
# ID, TARGET, min_nonce, max_nonce

#def mine_asc(puzzle_id, target, min_nonce, max_nonce):
# the mining module traverses the range min_nonce to max_nonce in ASCENDING ORDER
# the values min_nonce and max_nonce are int
# to mine like above, remember to convert min_nonce and max_nonce to hex
# basically replicate the code above within a loop
# remember that you might not find a solution -- signal this if you scanned the entire range

# now run your mining function on:

ID = 0xabcdeeee
TARGET = 0x000000000000000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
c = 2**23 #nonce size
min = 0 #smallest nonce
max = c - 1 #biggest nonce

# implement descending mining:
#def mine_desc(puzzle_id, target, min_nonce, max_nonce):
# same as above, but now you go from max_nonce down to min_nonce

# now run your descending mining function on (same as above):

ID = 0xabcdeeee
TARGET = 0x000000000000000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
c = 2**23 #nonce size
min = 0 #smallest nonce
max = c - 1 #biggest nonce

# Notice something?

# implement random mining: pick a nonce in the range randomly
#def mine_rand(puzzle_id, target, min_nonce, max_nonce):
# recall that there mighn not be a solution, so count up to max_nonce-min_nonce, after you did as many attempts give up

# run mine_rand() with the same parameters as above
# run it several times, do the results change? do you notice that sometimes it will pick up the min/max solution?

# Let's increase the puzzle difficulty now:
ID = 0xabcdeeee
TARGET = 0x0000000000000000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
c = 2**23 #nonce size
min = 0 #smallest nonce
max = c - 1 #biggest nonce

# Looks like our nonce range will not do here; 
# we either have to lower the difficulty back to the original one, or change the puzzle_id

# Let's play with some other parameters:

ID = 0xaaaaaaaa
TARGET = 0x000000000000000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
c = 2**23
min = 0
max = c - 1

# what is faster? asc? desc? rand? Did you try rand at least 5 times?

# Let's play with the parameters some more:
ID = 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
TARGET = 0x000000000000000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
c = 2**23
min = 0
max = c - 1

# What is fastest here?

# Let us now go to the Bitcoin's nonce of 32 bits:

ID = 0xfaa
TARGET = 0x0000000000000000ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
c = 2**32
min = 0
max = c - 1

# Try mining in descending order first
# You should get nonce = 0xff2a9f50 as a solution in about (50 sec - 2min, depending on your cpu)
# Try mining in ascending order 
# solution = 0x14a822c takes a bit longer
# Let's try rand for a few minutes?
# Found: 0xcadf6421 with rand in 4 min -- significantly slower

# What do miners actually do?


# One interesting trick:
# Same puzzle as before, but let us try a different range of all 32 bit nonces:
# Let us mine in ascending order now

ID = 0xfaa
TARGET = 0x0000000000000000ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
c = 2**32

# What happened here?

# Let's simulate a mining pool:
ID = 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
TARGET = 0x0000000000000000ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
c = 2**32

# Group1:

# Group2:

# Group3:
min = (9*c)//(12)

min = (8*c)//(12)
max = (9*c)//(12) - 1

# Group5:
min = (7*c)//(12)

# Group6:
min = (6*c)//(12)
max = (7*c)//(12) - 1

# Group7:
min = (5*c)//(12)
max = (6*c)//(12) - 1

# Group8:
min = (4*c)//(12)
max = (5*c)//(12) - 1

# Group9:
min = (3*c)//(12)
max = (4*c)//(12) - 1

# Group10:
min = (2*c)//(12)
max = (3*c)//(12) - 1

# Group11:

##One thing I lied about: Real nonce is of fixed size; 
# so always 32 bits for example, and not an int range; 
# we were actually wastefull, as 0x0 and 0x0000 are not the same for hashing (sha256 sees them as bytes)
# you can try to implement this as an exercise; and please send me a solution, so <i don't need to do it on my own :-)
