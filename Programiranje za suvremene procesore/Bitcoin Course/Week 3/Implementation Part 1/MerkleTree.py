# As a side note
# In Bitcoin computing the Merkle root id done in little-big-little-endian fashio:
# 1) First, every binary hash is represented in little endian
#       For us, this would mean we would have to do something like:
#       raw_hashes = [bytes.fromhex(h) in hex_hashes]
#       input_hashes = [h[::-1] for h in raw_hashes]
# 2) The array input_hashes is processed left to right (i.e. like a big-endian)
# 3) The Merkle root is computed in big endian, but the value that is used in Bitcoin is little.endian
#       So we would need to return:
#       merkle_root(input_hashes)[::-1].hex()
# Go figure :)

# If you have the time, you can code this into your MerkleTree implementation as a constructor parameter
#   I.e. you coud have init(self,hashes,bitcoin=False), and if bitcoin = True do the above encoding
