# Stuff we'll need to code our blockchain:
from hash import hash
import json # this is for serializing blocks ... more on this in a bit

# What do we guard in a block?
# The data
# And the previous block hash

# Therefore our class will have the following:

class Block:
	def __init__(self, data):
		self.data = data
		self.prev_hash = None
		# An important note here: the block constructor will only set the data field
		# prev_hash value will be set by the blockchain class
		# If you do not like this, just extend the constructor; we will in fact do this a bit further ahead

# To compute a hash of the entire block (data + prev hash) we need to convert it into bytes
# Our approach is the following:
# We will convert the Block object into a JSON document, and then convert this thing to bytes

# The way we will serialize here (as opposed to the hashing exercize):
# Why? Just to illustrate that many serializations are possible

	def serialize(self):
		if self.prev_hash == None:
			d = { 'data': self.data }
		else:
			d = { 'data': self.data,
			      'prev_hash': self.prev_hash }
		return bytes(json.dumps(d, sort_keys=True).encode('utf-8')) 
		# Strictly speaking, converting to bytes here is not necessary, as json dump is already in bytes
		# But this way it is more clear what is going on

# We will also want to print blocks for debugging and checking results
# So we will provide a method for this:

	def __str__(self):
		return '(Data: {} - Previous: {})'.format(self.data, self.prev_hash)


# Let's create some blocks now, and see how they look

genesis = Block(0)
print(genesis)

genesis.prev_hash = 'Is this dumb?' # This is how to set the prev_hash field

print(genesis)

block1 = Block(hash(b'hola'))
print(block1)

# Next we move onto defining a blockchain class
# As stated in the class, a blockchain is a linked list of blocks
# To guard the blocks we will use a dictionary
# This will also allow us to implement hash pointers using the hash only (and no other piece of data)
# BTW this is, as far as I know, the only way people implement hash pointers these days

# Note that we could also use an array, and our hashpointes can consist of pairs (position,hash)


# Our blockchain class will therefore guard blocks inside a dictionary (we'll call it elements)
# We will also remember the head of the chain at any given time
# As a side note; if you know what a 'fork' is, and are confused by our implementation, just be a bit patient

class Blockchain:
	def __init__(self):
		self.elements = {}
		self.head = None

# Next, we need to enable adding the blocks to the blockchain
# What happens here is that you will receive the data for the next block, and we will append it as the new head of the chain
# Nothing complicated here:
# Our method has the signature add_block(self,data)
# 1) We receive the data
# 2) We create a new block containing this data --> block = Block(data)
# 3) We are always appending to the current head, so we just set block.prev_hash = self.head
# 4) We also have to compute the hash of the block to add it to the elements dictionary
# 		For this, we simply serialize the block --> block.serialize()
#		We compute the hash of this --> hash(block.serialize())
#		And we guard the hex value of this (to make things legible) --> hash(block.serialize()).hex()
#		We add our new block to the elements dictionary under this key

# More precisely, we do something like the following:

	def add_block(self, data):
		block = Block(data)

		block.prev_hash = self.head # first head is None by default

		serialize_to_hash = hash(block.serialize()).hex() # compute the new key/i.e. the new hash pointer to the head
		self.elements[serialize_to_hash] = block # insert the data in the dictionary under the computed key
		self.head = serialize_to_hash # make the new hash pointer the head of the blockchain

# We should be able to return the blockchain's head, so let us implement a method for this:

	def get_head(self):
		return self.head

# We also need to print the entire blockchain
# But this is easy, we can just scan the dictionary elements for this (it is already stored in the order of insertion)

	def print_blockchain(self):
		print('\n')
		for key in self.elements.keys():
			print('Key: {}'.format(key))
			print('Block: {}'.format(self.elements[key]))

# Just a dummy function for now, will explain below
	def check(self,hash_pointer):
		return True


# Let's make a blockchain now:


blockchain = Blockchain()
blockchain.add_block('one')
#blockchain.elements = {h(bl1): bl1}
#blockchain.head = h(bl1)

blockchain.add_block('two')

# The data itself can be anything:
blockchain.add_block(4)

blockchain.print_blockchain()

# A task for you: check if there are inconsistencies
# I.e. implement the following class method:

# def check(self, block_hash):
# The method receives the block_hash, 
# and should follow hash pointers all the way to the first block in order to see if they were tampered with
# so you just have to: retrieve the block (check that it exists as well)
# hash it (you already saw how in the add_block)
# check that the hash matches
# get the prev_hash value
# continue till genesis

# here is some data to test your implementations:


# Insert data:
